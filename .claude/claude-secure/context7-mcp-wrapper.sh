# Wrapper for direct Context7 MCP server via HTTP endpoint (https://mcp.context7.com/mcp)
# This wrapper is kept for future use; currently context7-mcp uses HTTP config directly.
# If needed again, this fetches CONTEXT7_API_KEY from 1Password without plaintext cache.

# For now, this script is not used; see .claude.json context7-mcp config for HTTP setup
